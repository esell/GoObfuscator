# GoObfuscator

My thinking is using the built-in go AST tools so that I can 
eventually do more than simple search/replace type things, but 
instead inject different techniques based on what the "node" is in the AST.

Currently the only thing that works (somewhat) is renaming structs (and their properties) with random gibberish.
